The MetaLink 8051 Assembler manual is included in this archive file since
we're giving it away as free advertising.  The manual enclosed herein is
supplied in two (2) separate files (ASM51.DOC and TABLES.DOC) for printing
considerations should you want to print the manual.  ASM51.DOC is designed
to be printed at 10 (or 12) characters per inch and 6 lines per inch on
standard 8 1/2" by 11" paper.  Your printer should have no margins set 
and should not automatically skip perforations.  TABLES.DOC is designed 
to be printed at 17 characters per inch and 8 lines per inch (standard 
condensed print on most dot-matrix printers).  The tables included in
TABLES.DOC can then be pasted in the holes left during the printing of 
ASM51.DOC (pages shown below).  Note that page numbers are NOT printed at
the bottom of the tables, but refer to the actual page printed.
